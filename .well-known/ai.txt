# AI Training and Usage Policy

## Overview

This document describes the IPv6-Only Tools project's policies regarding
AI/ML training, crawling, and automated access.

## Training Data Policy

### Allowed Uses

✅ **Permitted:**
- Reading this code to understand IPv6 concepts
- Using as reference implementation for IPv6 tools
- Learning IPv6 networking principles
- Educational purposes with attribution
- Research into IPv6 security and best practices

### Restricted Uses

⚠️ **Requires Attribution:**
- Including code snippets in training datasets
- Using documentation as training corpus
- Incorporating algorithms into AI models
- Using test cases for model validation

Attribution requirement: Cite as:
```
IPv6-Only Tools Project
https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/ipv6-only
License: MIT + Palimpsest v0.8
```

❌ **Not Permitted:**
- Commercial AI training without explicit permission
- Training models to generate security exploits
- Using for adversarial security testing without authorization
- Circumventing rate limits or access controls

## Crawling and Automation

### Web Scraping

This project's documentation and code are public, but:
- Respect rate limits
- Use appropriate User-Agent headers
- Cache responses appropriately
- Follow robots.txt directives

### API Access

If we provide APIs in the future:
- Authentication required for automated access
- Rate limits apply
- Terms of service must be followed
- No scraping disguised as legitimate use

## Copyright and Licensing

All code and documentation are under:
- **MIT License** for permissive use
- **Palimpsest v0.8** for additional protections

See licence.txt for full terms.

### Derivative Works

If training AI on this codebase:
1. Maintain attribution in generated code
2. Respect original license terms
3. Document AI involvement in derivative works
4. Follow academic citation standards if publishing

## Research and Academic Use

### Encouraged:
- Security research (responsible disclosure)
- Performance analysis
- IPv6 adoption studies
- Network protocol research

### Required:
- Cite in publications
- Share findings (where appropriate)
- Report vulnerabilities privately
- Acknowledge in derivative works

## Large Language Models (LLMs)

### For Model Developers:

If including this project in training data:
1. Include full license text (licence.txt)
2. Maintain attribution metadata
3. Flag security-sensitive code appropriately
4. Respect ethical AI guidelines

### For Model Users:

If an LLM generated code based on this project:
1. Verify the code (don't trust blindly)
2. Check for security issues
3. Understand what it does (especially networking code)
4. Attribute if substantial portions used
5. Test thoroughly before deployment

## Security Considerations

### Responsible AI:
- Don't train models to generate exploits
- Don't use AI to scan networks without authorization
- Don't automate vulnerability discovery without disclosure
- Don't use AI to circumvent security measures

### IPv6-Specific:
- Network scanning tools require authorization
- Security features must not be weaponized
- Tunneling configurations are site-specific
- Don't auto-generate malicious IPv6 packets

## Data Privacy

This project does not collect user data, but if AI systems process:
- Network configurations (may contain sensitive info)
- Security scan results (private network data)
- Tunnel credentials (must be protected)

Ensure privacy-preserving practices.

## Contact

Questions about AI/ML use of this project:
- Email: ai-policy@ipv6-only.example.com
- GitHub Discussions: AI/ML Usage category

## Commercial AI Companies

If you are:
- OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Microsoft, etc.
- Training foundation models
- Building code generation systems

Please contact us before including in training corpus:
ai-policy@ipv6-only.example.com

We're open to collaboration with proper attribution and ethical use.

## Updates

This policy may be updated. Check:
https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/ipv6-only/blob/main/.well-known/ai.txt

Last updated: 2024-11-22

## Machine-Readable Format

For automated tools:

```yaml
project: IPv6-Only Tools
repository: https://github.com/Hyperpolymath/ipv6-only
license: MIT AND Palimpsest-0.8
attribution_required: true
commercial_training: contact_required
ethical_use: required
security_sensitive: true
contact: ai-policy@ipv6-only.example.com
```

## Robots.txt Equivalent

If we were a website, our robots.txt would be:

```
User-agent: GPTBot
Disallow: /

User-agent: ChatGPT-User
Disallow: /

User-agent: CCBot
Allow: /

User-agent: anthropic-ai
Allow: /

User-agent: *
Allow: /
```

We prefer opt-in for commercial AI training.
